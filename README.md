# Wilkinson-Polynomial-Roots-Visualization
A MATLAB script to compute and visualize the roots of Wilkinson polynomials for degrees n = 21 to n = 30.

# Description 
This repository contains a MATLAB script that calculates and plots the roots of Wilkinson polynomials in the complex plane. The Wilkinson polynomials, known for their sensitivity to numerical errors, provide a compelling example of numerical instability in root-finding algorithms. The script also analyzes the numerical error and condition number for the 20th root of the degree-30 polynomial. 

# Code Overview
The script includes:
- Root Calculation: Generates Wilkinson polynomial coefficients for degrees n = 21 to n = 30. Computes the numerical roots of each polynomial.
- Visualization: Plots the roots in the complex plane for each degree. Highlights the estimated 20th root for the degree-30 polynomial.
- Error Analysis: Computes the relative error and condition number for the estimated 20th root of the degree-30 polynomial.

# Usage 
Run the script in MATLAB:
```matlab
% Wilkinson Polynomial Roots Visualization
% Simply copy and paste the code into MATLAB and execute it.
